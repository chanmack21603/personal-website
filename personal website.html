    projects she's edited over the past few months in order to make that "perfect" portfolio. This portfolio contains <br>

<h2>A little bit about Christen...</h2>
    <br>
<p2>A 2018 graduate of the University of New Hampshire, Christen originally majored in Communication, <br>
     working for the school’s athletic department broadcasting department and student newspaper, The New Hampshire. <br>
     Since August of 2018, Christen has been working for ESPN in the digital video department, <br>
     optimizing videos not only for espn.com and the ESPN app, but ESPN’s broad portfolio of YouTube channels. <br>
    They have been working to lead ESPN’s digital coverage of UFC, MMA, and boxing <br>
     and every fight night works to provide a vast assortment of highlights for not only the ESPN audience, <br>
      but ESPN’s editors to embed in stories as well. <br>
      <br>
    In 2022, Christen publicly came out as non-binary and presents with he/they pronouns. <br>
     At about the same time, Christen decided to make a career change and work full time during the day <br>
     to learn web design. Working on design allows Christen to be far more creative than they were working for ESPN <br>
      and allows them to work with people at a more interactive level. Christen cares greatly about what their clients <br>
       think of their products, whether that be an edited video, or something graphically designed. <br>
        Now, they plan to add websites and web designs to their portfolio of creativeness. <br>
        If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to let Christen know at the link below, <br>
         where you can send them an email, check out their resume and much more. <br> </p2>
